# BoxBox - Enhanced Version

ComfyUI custom node for interactive box/region selection with advanced features.

## 🎉 What's New in This Enhanced Version

This is an improved fork of the original [BoxBox](https://github.com/mercu-lore/BoxBox) with several bug fixes and new features:

### ✅ Bug Fixes

1. **Fixed Image Loading After ComfyUI Update**
   - Updated image URL construction to use ComfyUI's API helper
   - Added proper filename encoding for special characters
   - Improved error handling with fallback mechanisms

2. **Fixed Backend Issues**
   - Corrected temp directory usage to use ComfyUI's proper temp folder
   - Fixed HTTP response format (now returns proper `web.json_response`)
   - Sanitized filenames to prevent path separator issues

3. **Fixed Coordinate Scaling**
   - Removed duplicate coordinate division (was happening in both frontend and backend)
   - Coordinates now correctly convert from display space to original image space

4. **Fixed Intermediate Node Support**
   - Added recursive node chain traversal to find source images
   - Now works with processing nodes (Brightness, Blur, etc.) between LoadImage and BoxSelector
   - Searches up to 20 levels deep in the node graph

### 🆕 New Features

1. **Aspect Ratio Memory**
   - Remembers your last selected aspect ratio using localStorage
   - Persists across browser sessions and system restarts
   - Keeps aspect ratio locked when drawing new selections

2. **Selection Restoration**
   - Automatically restores your previous selection when reopening the selector
   - Shows the blue selection box from your last session
   - Allows you to adjust or modify existing selections

3. **Improved User Experience**
   - Removed annoying popup alerts for small images
   - Better console logging for debugging
   - Image error handler with helpful messages
